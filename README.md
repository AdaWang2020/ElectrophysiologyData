# Open Datasets in Human Electrophysiology

### Focus

This is a list of available electrophysiological data, focused on local field potential (LFP) type measurements from EEG, MEG, and ECoG/iEEG. Most of the listed data is from humans, though some animal-model LFP data may also be listed. 

Everything listed here includes some openly-accesible data for research purposes, requiring, at most, registration for access. 

This list is curated by the VoytekLab, but all data is by and from external sources.
